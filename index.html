    <h2>01coin is an innovative, cryptographically-secured digital asset ledger based on blockchain technology. Developed in part from the core code behind Dash, 01coin includes many innovative enhancements.</h2>
    <p>
      01coin aims to become the most community-centric project in all of crypto. Born out of its own ashes when the original development team mysteriously disappeared one month after the coin launched, it is now completely managed and operated by the community. This includes a large and dedicated team of community moderators always ready and willing to help new users. It also includes a strong principle of community governance: no decisionwill be made unilaterally by a single individual or by an oligarchy of the few. Every step forward for 01coin will be determined by community votes and masternode governance. As such, we donâ€™t know yet exactly what 01coin will look like a year from now, but we do know it will look exactly like the coin you want it to be.
    </p>
